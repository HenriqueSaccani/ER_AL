# Entity Resolution with Active Learning

## Overview

Entity Resolution (ER) is a critical process for linking records within noisy datasets, aligning them with the same real-world entity. This project investigates the application of Active Learning (AL) strategies across diverse ER tasks to enhance labeling efficiency.

## Key Features

- **AL Approach:** The project explores the effective use of AL in ER, showcasing its positive impact on overall process efficiency.

- **Real-world Experimentation:** Practical insights are derived from experiments on real-world datasets, illustrating the successful integration of AL for ER.

- **Abstract Paper:** For a detailed overview, refer to the abstract paper available in the file [The Case for Multi-task Active Learning.pdf](The%20Case%20for%20Multi-task%20Active%20Learning.pdf).

- **Research Publication:** The findings were published in the [29th Italian Symposium on Advanced Database Systems](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2994/paper40.pdf) .

## Conclusions

In exploring ER as a multi-task Active Learning problem, surprising insights have been uncovered. AL can achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal feature engineering, using common ML algorithms. Preliminary results suggest that allocating 40% of the budget for AL-based blocking and the remaining 60% for AL-based matching is an effective configuration across datasets. Ongoing research involves combining various AL strategies, ML methods, and blocking techniques for a more in-depth analysis.

These findings not only contribute valuable insights to ER but also highlight the efficacy of Active Learning.
